# HalfCircleText

## Concept:

Inspired by a piece of concept art that lacked alignment and neatness, I took up the challenge to create an improved version using Python. The objective was to make it neater, cleaner, and customizable. This tool allows the user to replace the words with their own and offers flexibility in color selection. The advantage of using Python for this task is the capability to produce predictable and standardized outcomes as opposed to freehand drawings on software like Photoshop.

triv3.py - This version enhances text input and introduces color selection. The output is in PNG format.
