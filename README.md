# HalfCircleText

## Idea

I saw a piece of art, it wasnt all that particularly well done, it wasnt even, wasnt fully neat and organic and I thought to myself I wonder if I can create the same thing but imporve on the concept. Can I make it neater, cleaner, can I eventually replace the words with my own, change colors etc... all using Python and the ability to once created have predictable and standardized outcomes vs someone drawing this free hand on Photoshop etc.

## Versions

Each Version is building on itself to create a better and more flexible version of this program.

V1-V5 each version does more and more.

V5 - The current version I am working on is V5 which has more customizable color selections and cleaner input selection than previous version.
